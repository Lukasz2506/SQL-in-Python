# After install the psycopg2 module using pip install in terminal,
# importing module in the script. Here is named as pg2

import psycopg2 as pg2

# this is a password saved as variable
secret = 'my_password'

# Connect with a database:

conn = pg2.connect(database='dvdrental', user='postgres', password=secret)

# Open cursor to perform operations:
cur = conn.cursor()

# Execute operation
cur.execute('SELECT * FROM payment')

# Call a data you want, i.e. fetchone call only first row of data from the table.
# There might be also fetchmany(n), fetchall()
print(cur.fetchone())

# You can storage data as a variable
data = cur.fetchmany(5)

print('all data: ', data)

# you can call a specific row and specific column making slicing
print('first row, second column: ', data[0][1])

# During the lesson I support with https://www.psycopg.org/docs/install.html#prerequisites
